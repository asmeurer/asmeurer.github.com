Well, I got accepted into the Google Summer of Code program for 2009. I
will be working on [SymPy][], a computer algebra system written and run
in Python. I will be working on building an ordinary differential
equation engine for it, as its present capabilities are very limited.
You can look at my application [abstract][]. SymPy requires that I blog
about my work at least once a week, so here it is. More will be posted
here later.

<div>
Originally I started this blog on [blogger][], but I think WordPress
will be a little better.
 <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Namely, it seems to support
</span>[<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">plugins</span>][]<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">,
so I can insert LaTeX code much easier.</span> It would seem that only
blogs not hosted at wordpress.com support plugins.

So I think I will  just use [LaTeXiT][] and do it manually.  Oh well.
 Anyway, here is the Divergence Theorem, which nicely shows both
mathematical beauty and LaTeX beauty.[![divergence-theorem][]][]
