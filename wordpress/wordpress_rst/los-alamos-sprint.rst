Last weekend, Luke came to visit Ondrej in Los Alamos, so I decided to
drive him up from Albuquerque and visit him again. It was nice meeting
Luke and seeing Ondrej again.

Aside from coding (the main thing that I did was fix an ugly match bug
that was preventing dsolve() from recognizing certain ODEs), we visited
the atomic museum in Los Alamos, the `Valles Caldera`_, and some of the
surrounding hot springs.

WordPress seems to insist on flipping some of them (I can't fix it):

This is one of three posts that I plan on doing this week. I just
finished my GSoC project today/last night, so I will be blogging about
that. I plan on doing a post on the method of Undetermined Coefficients,
as well as some other things that I managed to do. The other post will
be my general musings/advice for GSoC. That will probably be my last
post here in a while. I plan on continuing work with SymPy, but I get
very busy with classes, so I most likely won't be doing much until next
summer.
