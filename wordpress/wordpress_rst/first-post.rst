Well, I got accepted into the Google Summer of Code program for 2009. I
will be working on \ `SymPy`_, a computer algebra system written and run
in Python. I will be working on building an ordinary differential
equation engine for it, as its present capabilities are very limited.
You can look at my application \ `abstract`_. SymPy requires that I blog
about my work at least once a week, so here it is. More will be posted
here later.

Originally I started this blog on `blogger`_, but I think WordPress will
be a little better.  Namely, it seems to support \ `plugins`_\ , so I
can insert LaTeX code much easier. It would seem that only blogs not
hosted at wordpress.com support plugins.

So I think I will  just use `LaTeXiT`_ and do it manually.  Oh well.
 Anyway, here is the Divergence Theorem, which nicely shows both
mathematical beauty and LaTeX beauty.\ |divergence-theorem|
