So the latest version of SymPy finally made it into `fink`_. Normally,
this wouldn't be that exciting, but before this, the most recent version
in fink was 0.6.4, which was before I ever joined the project, with the
exception of two commits. So this is the first version on fink to
include all of my contributions, including my 2009 Google Summer of Code
work.
