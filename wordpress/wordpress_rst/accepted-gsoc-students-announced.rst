| Join me in congratulating these students on their acceptance.
|  In case you don't know for some reason, Google Summer of Code is a
program where Google pays students to write code for open source
projects. SymPy was accepted as a mentoring organization this year. The
goal of the summer is to help the students learn new skills, in
particular in our case:
|  \* contributing to open source
|  \* working with the community
|  \* learn git, pull requests, reviews
|  \* teach them how to review other's people patches
|  \* do useful work for SymPy
|  \* have fun, and encourage the students to stay around

Also see my `previous blog post`_ about it.
