So I was browsing the [Google Open Source Blog][], when I found a link
to this [Git Tutorial][].  I wish I had found this a month ago when I
started learning Git.  SymPy only has a very basic tutorial for Git.
 Their main tutorial is still written for Mercurial, which they used
until recently.

Anyway, I have been reading the tutorial, and so far it is awesome, so I
thought it would make a good post here.
