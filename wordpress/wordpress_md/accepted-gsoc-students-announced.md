Join me in congratulating these students on their acceptance.  
In case you don't know for some reason, Google Summer of Code is a
program where Google pays students to write code for open source
projects. SymPy was accepted as a mentoring organization this year. The
goal of the summer is to help the students learn new skills, in
particular in our case:  
\* contributing to open source  
\* working with the community  
\* learn git, pull requests, reviews  
\* teach them how to review other's people patches  
\* do useful work for SymPy  
\* have fun, and encourage the students to stay around

Also see my [previous blog post][] about it.
