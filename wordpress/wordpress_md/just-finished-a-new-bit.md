I just finished first order homogeneous equations, as well as my
logcombine function, and I have pushed them to
<http://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/odes-stable>.  So expect a major
blog posting about them both soon (it is midnight right now, so bedtime,
maybe tomorrow).

If you are a member of the SymPy project reading this, *please*, review
my patches.  I have already submitted exact equations and the
logcombine function, and neither of them have made it in.  And the more
reviewing that there is, the better for my code.
