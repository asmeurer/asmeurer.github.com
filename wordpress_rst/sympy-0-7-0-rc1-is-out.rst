My blog post is a little late this week because I wanted to be able to
announce this. I have released the first release candidate for SymPy
0.7.0 (see `this previous blog post`_ for a little bit of what's new
since the last release). You can download source (Linux/Mac OS X
version) `here`_ and the Windows installer
`here <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/downloads/detail?name=sympy-0.7.0.rc1.win32.exe>`__.
Please download it at test it.

Unfortunately, I discovered soon after releasing it that the code does
not work in Python 2.4 or 2.5. I will soon release SymPy 0.7.0.rc2 to
fix this. Please test it in Python 2.6 and 2.7 until then, or test the
`0.7.0 branch`_ of the official SymPy repository.

If everything goes smoothly, then the full release should be out in a
week or so. Watch this blog or the `official SymPy blog`_ for the
announcement.
