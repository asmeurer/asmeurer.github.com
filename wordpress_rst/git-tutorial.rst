So I was browsing the `Google Open Source Blog`_, when I found a link to
this `Git Tutorial`_.  I wish I had found this a month ago when I
started learning Git.  SymPy only has a very basic tutorial for Git.
 Their main tutorial is still written for Mercurial, which they used
until recently.

Anyway, I have been reading the tutorial, and so far it is awesome, so I
thought it would make a good post here.
